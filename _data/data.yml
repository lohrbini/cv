    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      As a seasoned Systems Administrator, I have developed a comprehensive skill set encompassing both Windows and Unix environments. My journey began as a Windows System Administrator, where I honed my skills in maintaining and optimizing systems for seamless operations.
      Driven by a passion for home labbing and a desire to delve deeper into Unix systems, I transitioned my career to focus exclusively on Unix administration. This move allowed me to not only broaden my technical expertise but also gave me the opportunity to work on automation tools such as Ansible, Terraform, and GitLab CI.
      In the year 2022, I took on the responsibility of maintaining the Elastic Cloud Enterprise platform, showcasing my ability to manage complex and critical systems. This experience also led me to achieve certification as an Elastic Certified Engineer, validating my proficiency in implementing and managing Elastic Stack solutions.
      My expertise extends beyond traditional system administration, as I actively leverage automation tools to streamline processes and enhance efficiency. With hands-on experience in Ansible and Terraform, I have successfully automated routine tasks, ensuring consistency and reliability in system configurations.
      My commitment to continuous learning and adaptability has been key to navigating the dynamic landscape of IT. I bring a wealth of experience in Unix system administration, coupled with a strong foundation in automation, making me well-equipped to tackle the challenges of modern IT infrastructures.
      Looking ahead, I am eager to contribute my skills to innovative projects, collaborate with cross-functional teams, and stay at the forefront of emerging technologies in the ever-evolving field of systems administration.
